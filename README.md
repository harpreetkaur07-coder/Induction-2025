# Induction 2025
Day 1
31st July 2025
My first day at GNDEC started with Induction Programe in the auditorium where all the CSE and IT students were present. The atmosphere of the college auditorium is filled with full of enthusiasm and happiness.  After waiting for about 30 minutes , the host invited the first speaker. The speaker introduce us to college. Cheif guest and ADC of Ludhiana was also invited.  
Our Principal Sir  motivated us to make the best use of our time and also emphasis that it's 70 years of sharing brilliant brain . 
I learned an essential lesson: “Grap the  the opportunity; don’t wait for it to come to you.”
